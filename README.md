# movie_similarity_and_plot
We all love watching movies! There are some movies we like, some we don't. Most people have a preference for movies of a similar genre. For example 2001: A Space Odyssey and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, are movies based on aliens coming to Earth. We could conclude that both of these fall into the same genre of movies based on intuition, but that's no fun in a data science context.  The rapid growth of data collection has led to a new era of information. Data is being used to create more efficient systems and this is where Recommendation Systems come into play. Recommendation Systems are a type of information filtering systems as they improve the quality of search results and provides items that are more relevant to the search item.  In this notebook, we will quantify the similarity of movies based on their plot summaries available on IMDb.
